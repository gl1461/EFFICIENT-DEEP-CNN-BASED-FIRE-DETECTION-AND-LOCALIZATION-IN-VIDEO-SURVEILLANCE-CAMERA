## Description
Efficient Deep CNN-based Fire Detection and Localization in Video Surveillance Camera is a real-time fire detection and localization system developed using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for video surveillance cameras. The system harnesses the capabilities of CNNs to accurately detect and pinpoint fires in video feeds, facilitating prompt response and minimizing potential damage.

## Key Features and Highlights
- Real-time fire detection in video surveillance feeds
- Accurate localization of fires within video frames
- Utilizes deep CNNs for enhanced detection performance
- Enables timely response to fire incidents

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/gl1461/EFFICIENT-DEEP-CNN-BASED-FIRE-DETECTION-AND-LOCALIZATION-IN-VIDEO-SURVEILLANCE-CAMERA.git)
   ```
2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler.

## Usage
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Initialize the fire detection system
    FireDetectionSystem fireSystem;

    // Load video feed from surveillance camera
    VideoFeed feed("video_feed.mp4");

    // Detect and localize fires in the video feed
    fireSystem.detectFires(feed);

    return 0;
}
```
